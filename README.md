## Requirements

- Python: 3.8 or higher
- Django: 3.x or higher
- PostgreSQL: 10 or higher

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bright-smile-dental.git
   cd bright-smile-dental
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**
   Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   Create a new PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```

   In the PostgreSQL shell:

   ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE dental_management_db;
    CREATE USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
    ALTER ROLE yourusername SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
    ALTER ROLE yourusername SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
    ALTER ROLE yourusername SET timezone TO 'UTC';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dental_management_db TO yourusername;
    \q
   ```

   Update the DATABASES setting in settings.py:

   ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'dental_management_db',
            'USER': 'yourusername',
            'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
   ```

5. **Apply Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Collect Static Files**
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

## Setup

Before running the application, ensure all environment variables and configurations are correctly set.

- **Secret Key**: Update the SECRET_KEY in settings.py for production use.
- **Allowed Hosts**: Add your domain or IP address to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py.
- **CSRF Trusted Origins**: Update CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS if accessing the app from a different domain.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the Application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
   Log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier.

python manage.py test
```

## Assumptions

- **Working Schedule Format**: Stored as a JSON field.

## Configuration

- Update `DATABASES` in `settings.py` with PostgreSQL credentials.
- Adjust `STATIC_URL` and `STATICFILES_DIRS` for serving static files.
